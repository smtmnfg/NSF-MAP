# Repository for "NSF-MAP: Neurosymbolic Multimodal Fusion for Robust and Interpretable Anomaly Prediction in Assembly Pipelines" Paper
This repository contains derived datasets, implementation of methods experimented and introduced in the paper titled "NSF-MAP: Neurosymbolic Multimodal Fusion for Robust and Interpretable
Anomaly Prediction in Assembly Pipelines".

# 1. Data Preprocessing #

This folder contains the codes used to extract the analog and multimodal datasets which was created from the Future Factories(FF) Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramyharik/ff-2023-12-12-analog-dataset)
[Codes for preprocessing:Multimodal dataset preprocessing.ipynb, Analog dataset preprocessing.ipynb, Combine_MM_Data.ipynb]

The final preprocessed multimodal dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l7_Blmk_RrsLHqcW_4F7-ELtll_ZGyDv?usp=sharing

The final preprocessed analog dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v-UyJqlZMG68Mwd2Gict9E885MS023iR?usp=sharing

It also includes the additional experiments done to investigate the feature importance of sensor variables.[Feature_importance_experiments.ipynb]
